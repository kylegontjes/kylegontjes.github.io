My name is Kyle Gontjes, a 5th year PhD Candidate in Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Michigan.

My research leverages clinical metadata and whole-genome sequencing to study the evolution and spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales in complex patient populations, including long-term acute care hospitals and households.
