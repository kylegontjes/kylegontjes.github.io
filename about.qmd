## Biography

A native of Grand Rapids, I graduated from [Calvin University](http://www.calvin.edu/) in 2017 with a B.Sc. in Biology.\
\
I followed my passion for infection prevention to the [University of Michigan School of Public Health](https://sph.umich.edu/), where I completed an MPH in Hospital & Molecular Epidemiology in 2020.\
\
There, I worked for [Dr. Lona Mody](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dgpm/lona-mody-md-msc), of the Division of Geriatric & Palliative Medicine, studying antibiotic-resistant bacteria and infection prevention in hospitals and nursing homes. \
\
Currently, I am in my 5th year of a PhD in Microbiology & Immunology. I work with [Dr. Evan Snitkin](https://thesnitkinlab.com/index.php) to leverage clinical metadata and whole-genome sequencing to study the evolution and spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales in complex patient populations, including long-term acute care hospitals and households. 

## Research interests

My career goal is to develop innovative solutions to combat antibiotic resistance by applying advanced genomic methods, data analysis methods, and wet lab experimentation to identify patient and bacterial features that drive the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. ​
