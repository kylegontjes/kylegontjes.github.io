My research leverages clinical metadata and whole-genome sequencing to study the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

# **Microbial evolution**

I leverage whole-genome sequencing data, phylogenetics, and epidemiological methods to evaluate the evolution of bacterial pathogens. Primarily focusing on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, I am also interested in the genomic drivers of bacterial infections.

# Microbial genomic epidemiology

I leverage observational and intervention studies to evaluate the distribution and determinants of colonization and infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms. Alongside descriptive analyses, I develop novel research methodologies and translational infection prevention research.

# Translational infection prevention research

Alongside my research on the genomic epidemiology of antibiotic-resistance organisms, I have also conducted translational infection prevention research on the epidemiology of colonization with pathogenic bacteria.

# Cultural commentaries

I also enjoy writing about a variety of topics. I’ve published commentaries on health education and the role of grace in medicine. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss these subjects or collaborate on a commentary.
